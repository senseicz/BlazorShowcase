# Blazor showcase

## Poetic love story about a c# developer penetrating front-end fortresses, guarded by angular/react/vue experts, using backend-like c# code (and bits of razor)

Code in this repo is for Core Frameworks Internal Arch Forum presentation. 

PowerPoint slides will be added.

Enjoy ;)
