# Blazor showcase

## Poetic love story about a c# developer penetrating front-end fortresses, guarded by angular/react/vue experts, using backend-like c# code (and bits of razor)

Code in this repo is for Core Frameworks Internal Arch Forum presentation. 

PowerPoint slides will be added.

Enjoy ;)

# How to run?

Ideally from a command line, switch to `/BlazorShowBackend` directory and do `dotnet run`. It will expose app on `https:\\localhost:7777`, so open your browser and go to that uri. For OnePass login, you should be on Absa network.
