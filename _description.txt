Blazor showcase will be a wild demo to show off some new technologies and best practices. First we look at
new security standards around SPAs and how to properly secure them using Duende.BFF project. Then we move to the
new kid of the block in communication standards for microservices called gRPC. Lastly, king of the show, Blazor,
will enter the stage and will demonstrate use of SQL Lite and Entity Framework Core running directly in the 
browser to sort and filter very large data loads in a real time with no use of server, incl. fully disconnected
environment.
